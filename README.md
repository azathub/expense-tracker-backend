That's a great idea\! A professional **README** file is essential for any API project. It serves as the main documentation entry point for yourself and any other developers.

Here is a complete template for your Expense Tracker API's `README.md` file, tailored to your project's structure (Express, Sequelize, JWT, and Swagger documentation).

# üìà Expense Tracker API

A robust RESTful API for personal financial management, allowing users to track expenses, manage wallets, set budgets, and generate detailed financial reports.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **User Authentication (JWT):** Secure user registration, login, and authorization.
  * **CRUD Operations:** Full management for Expenses, Wallets, Categories, and Budgets.
  * **Filtering & Sorting:** Dynamic querying of expenses by date, amount, category, and sorting.
  * **Financial Reporting:** Aggregated endpoints for monthly summaries, budget-to-actual comparisons, and wallet balance tracking.
  * **API Documentation (Swagger):** Built-in, interactive API documentation accessible via a web browser.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your system:

  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
  * **npm** (Comes with Node.js)
  * A **PostgreSQL** database instance (or your preferred SQL database supported by Sequelize).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd expense-tracker-api
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your configuration details.

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=3000

    # Database Configuration (PostgreSQL Example)
    DB_DIALECT=postgres
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASS=your_db_password
    DB_NAME=expense_tracker_db

    # JWT Secret
    JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_key
    ```

4.  **Run Migrations and Seed Data (if applicable):**
    Use your preferred method (e.g., Sequelize CLI commands) to set up the database schema.

    ```bash
    # Example Sequelize CLI commands
    npx sequelize db:migrate
    # npx sequelize db:seed:all
    ```

### Running the API

Start the server using the development script:

```bash
npm start
# OR (for development with hot-reloading)
npm run dev
```

The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000/api`.

-----

## üìñ API Documentation (Swagger)

The project includes interactive API documentation powered by Swagger UI.

Once the server is running, you can access the documentation at:

üëâ **`http://localhost:3000/api-docs`**

Use this interface to test endpoints, view request/response schemas, and understand security requirements.

-----

## üîê Security and Authentication

This API uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication.

1.  **Register/Login:** Obtain a JWT by calling the `/api/users/register` or `/api/users/login` endpoint. The token will be returned in the response body.

2.  **Authorization:** Include the token in the `Authorization` header of all protected requests (Wallets, Expenses, Budgets, Reports) using the **Bearer** scheme.

    **Header Example:**
    `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>`
